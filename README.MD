### PULSE-OF-RAIJIN
PulseOfRaijin is a project name inspired by Japanese mythology and modern software architecture:

- **Raijin (雷神)**: The god of thunder, lightning and storms in Japanese mythology. Known for his powerful and commanding presence in the heavens.

- **Pulse**: Represents the rhythmic, consistent pattern of requests - like thunder rolling across the sky. The system handles incoming traffic with the reliability and regularity of Raijin's thunderous drums.

The name embodies our goal of building a robust, high-performance system that processes requests with the power and consistency of nature's own rhythms.
